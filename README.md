## Description

Vocab Builder is a web application designed to help users enhance their vocabulary through an efficient and engaging learning process. The app allows users to add words to their personal dictionary, manage them, and learn them using a Spaced Repetition System (SRS). With daily review sessions, users can effectively retain new words and track their learning progress through XP, levels, and streaks. The app also features custom quizzes, word suggestions for misspelled words, and a responsive design with dark mode support. User authentication is securely handled using Firebase.
